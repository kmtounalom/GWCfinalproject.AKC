    <h2>Camryn Soo</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Camryn and I am a rising junior at Garfield High School. Growing up I was surrounded by characters like Barbie, Polly Pocket, and Cinderella. It did not really faze me until I realized my perception of who I wanted to be was a white blond girl. I hated feeling displaced and with this website I hope other minority girls wont have to feel that way. I am relatively new to coding but am motivated and excited continuing to growing.
