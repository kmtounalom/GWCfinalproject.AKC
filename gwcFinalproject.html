       <p align="left">Our goal is to educate and shed light on the underrepresentation of women minorities. With the skills we learned from the SIP GWC we learned how to use our resources and opportunities to learn about  current topics that has to do with equal representation within our community. We believe that gender and ethnicity is an important issue that needs to be touched on and worked towards bringing awareness to such an important topic to us.</p>
