  <h2>Teens:</h2>
  <p>Being apart of underrepresented minorities can be hard
    sometimes and it can really change your mood and how you
    view your life so here are some things you can do when
    you feel like you're alone in this big world.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Staying true to yourself is the most important thing
        when it comes to this stuff. You may feel lost and unsure
        of your path when you try to look for people to look up to
        but none of them look like you, so you can't relate. But
      this website will show you that there are amazing successful
    people out there, and they do look like you.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Another thing you should know is that it's okay to feel
      alone. This is normal. Try connecting with other girls within
      minorities to share your experiences together and reflect.
      This is a great way to gain support. You may not know this,
      but there are people experiecning the same thing you are.</li>
      <br>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a list of programs you can do to truly find your passion,
      whether its law, medicine, or computer science, or even just
