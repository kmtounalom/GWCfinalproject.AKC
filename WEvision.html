      Our goal is to educate and shed light on the under-representation
    of women minorities. With the skills we learned from the GWC SIP program, we learned
  how to use our resources and oppurtunities to learn about current topics that has to do
equal representation within our community. We believe that gender and ethnicity is an
important issue that needs to be touched on, and worked on so that we can bring awareness
to a topic that should be important to all of us.</p>

    <h2>Camryn Soo</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Camryn and I am a rising junior at Garfield High School. Growing up I was surrounded by characters like Barbie, Polly Pocket, and Cinderella. It did not really faze me until I realized my perception of who I wanted to be was a white blond girl. I hated feeling displaced and with this website I hope other minority girls wont have to feel that way. I am relatively new to coding but am motivated and excited continuing to growing.
