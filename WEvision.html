    <p>Growing up, one of the most empowering things as a young girl is envisioning your future self through someone who looks like you and has already done what you want to do. A major issue with this is that often enough the media doesn’t represent everyone equally. This puts girls in underrepresented minorities at an unfair disadvantage. At the surface, this issue may seem minor but subconsciously it makes the difference.
	Our goal with this website is to empower girls of all ethnicities to believe that whatever future they envision for themselves, whether it’s clear now or not, is obtainable. Our website gives girls easy access to read about role models, both old and young, in various career paths. A career quiz is also included to help girls see their current potential. Also there are various book recommendations and links for girls to start taking action for seizing their future now.

    <h2>Camryn Soo</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Camryn and I am a rising junior at Garfield High School. Growing up I was surrounded by characters like Barbie, Polly Pocket, and Cinderella. It did not really faze me until I realized my perception of who I wanted to be was a white blond girl. I hated feeling displaced and with this website I hope other minority girls wont have to feel that way. I am relatively new to coding but am motivated and excited continuing to growing.

    <h2>Abigail Girma</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Abigail Girma and I am a rising junior at Shorewood High School. I’m involved in a few leadership positions at my school, for example being apart Student Council and being a Step Team leader. With these positions I gained the passion of helping people in whatever craft I do. My interest in technology has motivated me to join GWC and this program to allow me to do projects like these where we can combine real life problems with technology so we can spread our message to the world.
