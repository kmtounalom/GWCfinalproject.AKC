    <p>Hi! My name is Cam and I am currently a high schooler in Washington.
      I have loved doodling, sketching, and being creative since before I could even properly write my name.
      A few years back  I started bullet journaling and then even more recently I started embroidering.
      The main problem I continued to run in to was staying consistent while balancing schoolwork.</P>
    <p>But this summer I am determined to break that chain!
      By starting an instagram account, I am hoping the support from other creators will only make me feel more accountable for making time for being creative.
      Often being busy student leads to priorities shifting and things such as being creative are left off the check list.
      But by moving it higher up my list my hoping I will be a happier person!</p>
